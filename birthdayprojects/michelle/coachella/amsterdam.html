		<p class="welcome">Lauren's favorite memory~! Well, Lauren wasn't there but it was still a pretty memorable trip, especially the time we traveled for an hour on a bus to go to the famous tulip field (the longest hour for me and my bladder) in Amsterdam, only to find out the tulip season was over two months prior. </p> 

		<p class="welcome"> Now that I'm thinking about it... why didn't we just check online or ask our hostel first if the tulip field was open before we left................................ Because we live in the moment, that's why. </p>
