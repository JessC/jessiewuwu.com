		<h1>San Francisco --- Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park to be exact</h1>
		<img src="../images/sf.jpg" alt="Michelle in San Francisco" width="600px">
		<p class="welcome">Peter's favorite memory~! That hill, your dead leg, your slow decline, your final collapse, the concerned bystander running to your aid while a group of us just stared and laughed at you from a distance. Yes, you at your finest. </p>

		<p class="welcome">And then there was that party at Peter's place. Remember how the freegan girl who was charging for the freegan cookies and how bitchy she was about you and Sophia eating them? She didn't even pay for the ingredients and she's trying to make a profit?! To be spiteful, you guys stole some cookies when she wasn't looking. Yes, you at your finest. </p>
