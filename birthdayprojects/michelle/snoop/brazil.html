		<p class="welcome">My favorite memory~! The minute we stepped foot into Rio de Janeiro was already an adventure. Word on the street: the best way to avoid getting robbed was to not look like tourists, but there we were - bright neon shirts, big summer floppy hats, CaLi gUrL accents, DSLRs hanging off our necks, we got it down to the T. </p>

		<p class="welcome">From your debit card information being stolen in the airport to us getting scammed by the henna tattoo douche at Leblon beach, it was all part of one of the best trips I've ever taken. You made a boyfriend whose shoulder you wouldn't let go before hanggliding, the sand flying because of your dead legs, and teaching our instructors the importance of eastside westside hand signs. We got off the bus and half-jokingly suggested eating at KFC...and then actually ate KFC with our bare hands (why do Brazilians eat fried chicken with utensils?!). You falling asleep during the entire bus tour. </p>

		<p class="welcome">Then, there was Sao Paulo where we destroyed my apartment, made GIFs, and waited for the maintenance guy to come to the apartment door and pick up our trash. You falling asleep on the city bus while going to Embu das Artes alone. </p>

		<p class="welcome">The cherry on the top: watching Fast 5 and then looking for Brazilian cops to reenact our favorite Vin Diesel scene.</p>
