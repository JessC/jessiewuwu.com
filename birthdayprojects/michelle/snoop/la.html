		<p class="welcome">Jimmy's favorite memory~! Remember the time we went to visit Jimmy at USC with Hiromi?  Remember how we made inappropriate jokes and ate too much in Chinatown? Remember how we went back to Jimmy's small two-person dorm and you wrote his paper for him while Hiromi helped him finish his art project, and I was useless so I just sat in the corner? No wonder this is Jimmy's favorite memory of you...</p>
