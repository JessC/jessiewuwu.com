			<p class="welcome">Kevin's favorite memory~! We love visiting you in New York City. Drunken pizza runs, spilling pizza on self in cab ride back, buying pizza for significant other but eating it yourself, more pizza adventures, not falling asleep in clubs, classy restaurants (fancy mac n cheese, Restaurant Week MOMA), not so classy places (WHITECASTLE, well you were there in spirit), watching Roscoe watch you sleep. We love it all.      </p>
