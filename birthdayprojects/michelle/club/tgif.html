			<p class="welcome">Hiromi's favorite memory~! Your first job together at the local movie theater where you gossiped about the latest AMC drama, caught the last showing after your shifts, dedicated your adolescent life to Star Wars and Harry Potter premieres. Best part? Getting half priced appetizers across the street at the fine establishment of TGI Fridays, pretending it's someone's birthday for the free bday dessert, and exploiting the AMC system by getting a handful of free movie passes after quitting. That may have been the turning point of your career.
